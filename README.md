# d3hoops

Project for gathering d3 hoops stats and displaying them in a [kenpom](https://kenpom.com) or [barttorvik](https://barttorvik.com) style interface. I am starting this project with zero JavaScript knowledge, so it should be an adventure! I plan to use the [sportsdataverse](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sportsdataverse) package for getting all of the data from the NCAA website.
